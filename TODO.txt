TODO
====

First Alpha:
--------------

* 100% coverage, trafis, coveralls, pep8 - Done

* Actions should be named tuple objects, it's nicer than plain tuples. - Done

* Explicit namespace tests. Since we use lxml all the time this already works
  as by magic, but we need to test for it. - Done

* Support for making a diffed xml with diff:<action> tags. - Done

First Beta:
-----------

* Command line utility - Done

* Support for making a pretty text diff - Done

First Final:
------------

* Documentation


Future releases:
----------------

* An xmlpatch2 utility/command that can apply the diffs.

* Support for the xmldiff diff format.

* Maybe a diff format that looks like a text diff, but understands XML
  structure and ignores ignorable whitespace? But that is also doable by
  just reformatting the XML and pretty printing it and then using a text
  diff, so maybe that's pointless.
