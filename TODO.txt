TODO
====

First release:
--------------

* Actions should be named tuple objects, it's nicer than plain tuples.

* Explicit namespace tests. Since we use lxml all the time this already works
  as by magic, but we need to test for it.

* Support for making a diffed xml with diff:<action> tags.

* Support for making a pretty text diff

* Command line utility

* Documentation


Future releases:
----------------

* An xmlpatch utility/command that can apply the diffs.

* Support for the xmldiff diff format.
